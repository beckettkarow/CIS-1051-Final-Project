Basic Stock Predictor Using Machine Learning in Python

***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

1. Done a little bit of research on machine learning in python, as well as some similar projects that other people have done in the past. 
2. Imported all of the libraries that I need to complete the project.
3. Looked over documentation of those python libraries to get a little understanding of the basics of them.
4. Selected the model that I will use to predict the prices of the stocks.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

1. Still need to train and test the data/model.
2. Still need to visualize data using matplotlib.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

1. Was having some issue using vscode so I switched over to idle and feel like it has been a lot better for me.
2. Initially wanted to predict the price of a stock over the course of a year, but realized that isn't really feasible and would probably be incredibly inaccurate. Now I am just going to predict the price of a stock after one day.
3. Still a little confused on some machine learning stuff.
