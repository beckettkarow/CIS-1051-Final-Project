# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stock Price Predictor Using Machine Learning in Python

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want to make a basic stock price predictor using machine learning in python.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will be designed using the python language. The main function of the program will be to predict a stock price's trajectory over the course of about one year. Additionally, I would like the program to output a graph predicting how the stock price will move. I think I will have the user select a stock from a list of about 30 or so. These will be some of the bigger stocks in the S&P 500. This will be done using machine learning.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I am sure that I will be able to make a program that can predict the price of a few stocks using machine learning.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be a program that can predict the price of about 30 or so pre-selected stocks and output a graph showing the stocks trajectory.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The very best outcome would be a program that can predict the price of any stock in the S&P 500 over the course of a year and output a graph showing the stocks trajectory.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I don't have any experience using machine learning, so I will definitely have to research some basic machine learning principles. I will also have to research how to make the graphs of the stocks' trajectory. Professor Rosen mentioned that Matplotlib could be good for this, so I will look into that.
