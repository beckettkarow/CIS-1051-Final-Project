# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stock Price Predictor Using Machine Learning in Python

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that uses machine learning to predict the trajectory of a stocks price over the course of the year. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I would like to create a program in python that uses machine learning to predict a stocks trajectory over the course of a year. Ideally, I would like to be able to do this for any stock in the S&P 500. However, I would be okay if I can only do it for 30 stocks or so. In addition to the price predictor, I would like the program to output a graph that shows the trajectory of the stocks price over the course of the year.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think a good outcome would be a program that can predict the final price of a stock after a year.
     - Maybe no graph output.
     - Can predict 10 or so stocks from the S&P500

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think a better outcome would be a program that can predict and show the trajectory of a stocks price over the course of a year.
    - Would output a graph showing the trajectory.
    - Can predict 30 or so stocks from the S&P500

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think the best outcome would be a program that can predict the trajectory of any stocks price from the S&P500
    - Maybe predict the trajectory up to 5 years

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I do not have any experience with machine learning, so I will definitely have to research some of those skills. Additionally, I will have to research how to create a graph that will show the stocks trajectory. Professor Rosen mentioned that Matplotlib could be a good way to do this, so I will definitely look into that. Doing some basic research on how stock prices move may also be helpful with creating this program.
